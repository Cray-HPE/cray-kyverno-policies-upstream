# Kyverno Policies

## About

This chart contains Kyverno's implementation of the Kubernetes Pod Security Standards (PSS) as documented at https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-standards/ and are a Helm packaged version of those found at https://github.com/kyverno/policies/tree/main/pod-security. The goal of the PSS controls is to provide a good starting point for general Kubernetes cluster operational security. These controls are broken down into two categories, Baseline and Restricted. Baseline policies implement the most basic of Pod security controls while Restricted implements more strict controls. Restricted is cumulative and encompasses those listed in Baseline.
